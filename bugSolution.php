The solution is to always use the strict comparison operator (`===`) when the data type needs to be explicitly verified before comparing variables.  This prevents unintended type juggling.

```php
$a = "10";
$b = 10;

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Equal";
} else {
  echo "Not equal";
}
```

This revised code accurately reflects the intended comparison, considering both value and data type.  This approach enhances code robustness and reduces the likelihood of unexpected results.
